## Overview

This project was my chance to take a step into Javascript, I had a lot of trouble with the logic and implementing it to my exact wishes, especially handling of the errors. Having to create my own errors and conditions as well as the whole logic was a bit challenging but I believe with more practice it can become better and better. Problem solving is not really the problem but in this case was the implementation of the solution.

I learnt more about CSS custom properties, semantic HTML % and responsive web design using relative units, CSS flexbox and Grid.
